# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description of Project
Going somewhere? Make sure to check the route before you head out. This fun exercise tracks the route of the Harvard-MIT bus by using Mapbox.

## How to Run
To view the webpage, please visit https://aelamothe.github.io/map-animation. Click the "Show stops between MIT and  Harvard" button to view a marker move along the bus route.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
As a next step, I'd like to add a bus animation to the map and live tracking. It would be cool if folks could see an ETA for when the bus would reach the next stop along the route.
